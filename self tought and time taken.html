hey mate
i want to honsetly say that in my imagination i feel and think of in like i can do it and like you know i am dreaming it in the day like i can bulid it but when comes to action i fail because i have not yet learned new things and like i am lacking of knowledge about such factor and topics in the web deveolpment
but the good part as you know i can do my best in future if you help me get out of this situation

you know i can code this in just 3hours if were using tutorail,internet code search and in even 10 minute i can create it using your help gpt but i do not because i like wan to prove my imigination become true and like the way i think should be converted into action but in hard and difficult topics that i do not know i get failed


i bulid it in the continous working of 12hours in 2 days,6 hours for each day continues but with a little short breaks like drink water and eat food only 
at first i start coding good html done css done and when i javascript i also done good in start 
but when things get hard i was like taking too mush time on it 
like trying different code of javascript to get exact result as expected 
some alternative approch worked while some gives permenat error 
but in the follow of logical breakdown i have gone upto :
Logical Breakdown (Step i have covered and not coverd with a reason)

1. Design the Feedback Form in HTML (done in less than approx 30mint)
2. Capture Form Input in JS (done in approx 1:30hour)
3. Push to an Array, Create a Feedback Object and save data in arry (done in approx 30mint)
4. save to local storage and retrive back the data (not done > reason: because i do not know about it and i have tried diffierent approchs but failed. approx 1 hour waste)
5. Loop Through the Array(not done > reason: because for now i am just going with one review as per page request also i have tried it but not working as because lack of knowledge and study about the topics of Array of object loop in function. approx 30 mint waste )

extra things i have done in the lefted time and worked propperly:

1. review, its genration, its desgin logic, its correct saveing in array (done in approx 3hours ) 
2. product genration from js to main page (done in approx 1hour)
3. user validation, product search for user, check elgiblity for review (done in approx 1hour)
4. recent review section just only for 1 review working (done in approx 1hours)
5. overall other things like reasearch,thinking, or doing css for the website (done in a total of 2 hours approx)
